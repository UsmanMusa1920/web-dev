# King choice website

A website for small startup that I developed called aluminum fabrications

The main project of the django that we deployed on `heroku` platform is inside `king_aluminum` of this directory. These files index.html, about.html, contact.html, hire.html, home.css, and home.js we used them when we want to move the application from being dynamic on `heroku` platform, to `render` platform which is mainly for static web application.

So, if what we mean the real django project is the `king_aluminum` folder of this directory.
