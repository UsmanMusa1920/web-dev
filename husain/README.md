# Husain website

A website for my friend called Husaini

The main project of the django that we deployed on `heroku` platform is inside `husainabubakar` of this directory. These files index.html, about.html, contact.html, home.css, home.js, IMG-20220730-WA0000.jpg, and 3286319.jpg we used them when we want to move the application from being dynamic on `heroku` platform, to <a href="https://render.com/">render</a> platform which is mainly for static web application.

So, if what we mean the real django project is the `husainabubakar` folder of this directory.
